# Capstone Prototyping Projects

Utilizing Windsurf, AUGMENT, Co Pilot, chat.openai.com and grok.com to code these projects or part of them.

Additional notes can be found inside each projects' README files.

- Declan Heenan

My primarily goal for the company was to understand the technical capabilities of the tools, I focused more on technical implementations that provides helpful information in terms of the capabilities of the AI tools when trying to implement advanced systems.
I focused on AI-related systems, using AI to create AI, which demonstrates the understanding these tools have.
I also provide prompting ideas, techniques, additional notes, etc, within the individual project README files that I have provided in this repository.
Most of the projects I've made are as listed below:

# Projects

### Smaller Prototype Examples

1. **Web Calculator**: This was a simple Python flask application to implement a web calculator.
2. **Web Database Panel**: This was a simple Python flask application to implement a web-based sqlite database editor, similar to a adminstrator database editor panel.
3. **Web Safetensor Model Viewer**: This was a simple Flask web-based graph visualizer for safetensor nn.Modules. This viewed each layer of AI models.

### Medium Prototype Examples

1. **Custom MCP Tools**: Created custom tools that AI models can utilize when solving the user query. Provides a variety of tools for context, milestones, tasks, document searching, and fast and deep thinking.

### Large Prototype Examples

1. **Next Frame Predict**: Attempt to re-implement the next-frame-prediction video diffusion model architecture from a research paper - could not test thoroughly but forward pass succeeded.
2. **Lightning Image Diffusion**: Attempt to implement a Image Diffusion model of high technicality - could not test thoroughly but forward pass succeeded.
3. **WaldoAI**: Attempt to implement a Visual Studio Code extension clone of Co-Pilot and AUGMENT - was not fully completed but got close. Utilizes Ollama, which runs locally, for utilizing AI models.

# Prompting Tips and Tricks Summary

- Providing as much context as possible in structured formats is VERY helpful for the AI models (write a prompt in notepad first)
- Doing it in steps instead of all at once greatly increases chance of success (implement A, then implement B, then C, then D, ...)
- Asking AI to refine your prompts is a great way to expand and edit your prompt
